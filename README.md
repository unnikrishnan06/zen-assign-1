=======================

This is the source repository for the CSS Zen Garden assignment in WATS1010:
Introduction to Web Development. This assignment is designed to allow you to
focus on design and presentation. You will create a new visual style for the
venerable demo website, http://CSSZenGarden.com. This website has been remade by many
web designers and developers over the years (check out their Github repo:
https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com), with several hundred examples
available to look at. You will create a new design for the website, and in
doing so you will practice an approach to graphic and interface design.

Requirements
------------

This assignment is broken into two deliverables. For each deliverable, you will
need to complete a different portion of the larger task of re-styling CSS Zen
Garden.

Part One: Redesign Concepts
---------------------------

First, you must come up with the concept of your new design. Look at the designs
featured on CSSZenGarden.com and think about how you would like to approach a
redesign of the page. What themes will you play with? What graphical style
could you pull off with your current skills?

Please note: You are not being judged on the quality of your graphic design
production skills. You should think about design from the user perspective and
try to benefit ease of use of the page. At the same time, you should attempt to
make the page as visually attractive as possible.

**Deliverables for Redesign Concepts:**

* Wireframes that show the placement of information on the page
* A written description of your approach to the redesign that outlines:
  * Your overall concept and/or theme
  * How you hope to impact/affect the user
  * Links to inspirational designs you have looked at

Part Two: CSS Zen Garden Redesign
---------------------------------

Once you have developed your concept, you will spend another week implementing
your designs. You must put together a finished redesign of the CSS Zen Garden
page. You may not alter the HTML at all in the CSS Zen Garden `index.html` file.

**Deliverables for Completed Redesign:**

* Updated `style.css` with a complete redesign of CSS Zen Garden
* New style that considers the following:
  * Information architecture/organization
  * Content grouping
  * Appealing graphic style
* Use of advanced selectors to facilitate styles
* Use of interactive elements such as ``:hover`` and ``:focus`` pseudoclasses
* Use of `animate`, `transition` or `transform` properties to enhance page content
